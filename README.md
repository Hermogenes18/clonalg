# CLONALG: The CLONal selection ALGorithm

In artificial immune systems, clonal selection algorithms are a class of algorithms inspired by the clonal selection theory of acquired immunity that explains how B and T lymphocytes improve their response to antigens over time called affinity maturation.

This project show how to implement the traditional CLONALG using Python3. The example of execution its shown in the jupyter notebook inside the project.

## Getting Started

All you need for running this project is [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html). It's also necessary to have the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library installed in your Python 3.x distribution.


### Prerequisites

Installing Python3.x:

```
apt-get install python3.x
```

Installing Jupyter Notebook with pip:

```
python3.x -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3.x -m pip install jupyter
```

Installing the NumPy library with pip:

```
python3.x -m pip install numpy
```
